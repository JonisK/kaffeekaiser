# Usage

To create tally sheets: Go to `kreuzliste` and run `python create.py <config filename>`,

# Requirements

All this stuff was tested with Python 3.6 and TeXLive on Xubuntu 16.04 LTS.
If you have problems with MiKTeX and Windows, use `\usepackage{lmodern}`
instead of `\usepackage{CormorantGaramond}`.
